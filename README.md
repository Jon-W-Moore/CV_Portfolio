Hello, My name is Jon Moore. I've just finished my B.S. in computer science at Oregon State after deciding to switch careers. I spent 5 years as a public school techer, and while there were many about being a teacher that I loved, it was time for a change. 

This repo contains some of the projects I completed earning my degree, but I have others! I completed courses in software developement, assembly and architecture, operating systems, networking, databases, data structures, web development, mobile development, and more. 

I have a wife, who is also a teacher, and two young kids. We both grew up Houston, and currently live just outside of town in Cypress.

If you have any question, please let me know!
